<h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a href="javascript:;">4.1. Where can I put my newly created Web pages?</a></h3>

<div class="answer">

<p>Many ISPs offer web space to their customers.
Disk space and bandwidth will be limited,
and there may be other restrictions;
for example, many do not allow commercial use of this space.</p>

<p>There are companies and individuals offering "free" web space.
Most are supported by advertising displayed on authors' web pages.
There are often restrictions, as with hosting provided by ISPs to their
customers.

</p><p>There are also many web space providers (aka presence providers) who will
sell you space on their servers.
Prices will range from as little as US$1 per
month, up to US$100 per month or more, depending upon your needs.
Non-virtual Web space is typically the cheapest, offering a URL like:
http://www.webhost.example/yourname/
For a little more, plus the cost of registering a domain name,
you can get virtual web space, which will allow you to have a URL like
http://www.yourname.example/.</p>

<p>If you have some permanent connection to the Internet, perhaps via leased
line from your ISP then you could install an httpd and operate your own Web
server. There are several Web servers available for almost all platforms.</p>

<p>If you just wish to share information with other local users, or people on
a LAN or WAN, you could just place your HTML files on the LAN for everyone to
access, or alternatively if your LAN supports TCP/IP then install a Web server
on your computer.</p>

	<h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="block-ads">4.3. How can I block my hosting service's advertisements?</a></h3>
	<div class="answer">

		<p> Check the Terms of Service (TOS) agreement for your hosting service.
		It almost certainly prohibits interfering with the advertisements they add
		to your web pages.
		If you use some trick to block their advertisements on your own, then your
		hosting service may delete your account for violating its TOS.
		</p><p> However, there may be other options.
		Some hosting services will remove the advertisements if you pay a small
		monthly fee.
		Others will remove their default pop-up advertisements if you add static
		banners yourself.</p>

</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="26">4.5.</a> <a name="index-better">Is there a way to get indexed better by the search engines?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p>There is no single technique, but a number of factors can help.

</p><ul>

<li>Search engines index the textual content of your site, so use a
meaningful <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>, use meaningful headings
(<code>&lt;H1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;H2&gt;</code>, and so on), and provide

<a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/feature/art3.htm">meaningful ALT text for images</a>.

</li><li>Many search engines
<a href="#frame-search">ignore frames</a>,
so avoid them, and be sure to provide useful NOFRAMES content if you do use
them.

</li><li>Most search engines ignore image maps, forms, and JavaScript, so make
sure that navigating your site doesn't depend on them.
Provide normal links for site navigation.

</li><li>Avoid using META refresh, because many search engines penalize sites
that use it (META refresh has been used to trick search engines).

</li><li>The indexing programs of some search engines (including AltaVista and
Infoseek) will also take into account
<code>&lt;META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="..."&gt;</code> tags that appear in
the <code>&lt;HEAD&gt;</code> part of your documents.
However, META keywords have been used to trick search engines, so many will
ignore your keywords list if you repeat a given keyword too often.
At this writing, "too often" means "more than 7 times" to some popular
engines, but that may change in the future as indexing programs are changed
to defend against trickery.

</li><li>If you include a
<code>&lt;META NAME="description" CONTENT="..."&gt;</code> tag in the

<code>&lt;HEAD&gt;</code> part of your documents,
then some search engines will use the content of this tag as your site's
description when displaying search results.
This won't affect your ranking in searches, but it can help search engine
users understand what your site offers when a search does find your site.
</li></ul>

<p> The CONTENT attribute of the META keywords and description
tags may contain up to 1022 characters, but no markup other than entities.

</p><p>You might want to preview your site with a text-only browser like Lynx,
to get an idea of how your site appears to search engines.

</p><p> Finally, note that some search engines ignore sites hosted by
well-known free hosting services.
Other search engines index only a certain number of documents per server,
so while early customers of free hosting services may be indexed, later
customers may be ignored.

</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="52">4.6.</a> <a name="no-index">How do I prevent my site from being indexed by search engines?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p> The Robots Exclusion Protocol allows Web site administrators to
specify parts of their sites that robots should not visit by providing a
/robots.txt document.


</p><p> The Robots META tag allows HTML authors to specify whether robots
should index a document, and whether robots should harvest additional
URLs from a document.
The Robots META tag requires no server administration.

</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="27">4.7.</a> <a name="redirect">How do I redirect someone to another page?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p> The most reliable way is to configure the server
to send out a redirection instruction when the old URL is requested.
Then the browser will automatically get the new URL. This is the
fastest and most efficient way, and is the only way described here
that can convince indexing robots to phase out the old URL.  For
configuration details consult your server admin or documentation (with
NCSA or Apache servers, use a Redirect statement in .htaccess).</p>

<p> If you can't set up a redirect, there are other possibilities.
These are inferior because they tell the search engines that there's
still a page at the old location, not that the page has moved to a new
location. But if it's impossible for you to configure redirection at
your server, here are two alternatives:</p>

<ul>

<li>Put up a small page with text like "This page has moved to
http://new.url/ -- please adjust your bookmarks."</li>

<li> A META Refresh tag won't work for all browsers and can break the
"back" button.
For example:
<br />
<code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="<var>[x]</var>; URL=<var>[newURL]</var>"&gt;</code>

<br />
which will load <var>[newURL]</var> after <var>[x]</var> seconds.
This should go in the HEAD of the document. But if you do this, also
include a short text saying "Document moved to <var>[newURL]</var>"
for other browsers.

</ul>

</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="54">4.8.</a> <a name="password">How do I password protect my web site?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p>Password protection is done through HTTP authentication.  The
configuration details vary from server to server, so you should read the
authentication section of your server documentation.  Contact your server
administrator if you need help with this.</p>

<p> JavaScript password scripts provide only a facade of security.
At a fundamental level, they work in one of two ways.
Some scripts convert the password into a URL, which keeps the document
secret by limiting the number of people who know its URL.
Some scripts check the password and then go to a specific URL, which
protects the document only from those who don't view the JavaScript source
to get the URL of the document.
Neither mechanism is really secure.

</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="no-cache">4.9. How do I stop my page from being cached?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p> Browsers cache web documents; they store local copies of documents to
speed up repeated references to documents that haven't changed.
Also, many browsers are configured to use public proxy caches, which serve
many users (e.g., all customers of an ISP, or all employees behind a
corporate firewall).
To effectively control how your documents are cached you must configure
your server to send appropriate HTTP headers.

</p><p> The <code>Expires</code> header is understood by virtually all caches.
The cached document will be retrieved again automatically once it has
expired.
The <code>Expires</code> header must contain an HTTP date, which must be
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), not local time.

</p><p> HTTP 1.1 introduced the <code>Cache-Control</code> header, which
provides more flexibility for telling caches how to handle the document.

</p><p> The configuration details vary from server to server, so check your
server documentation.


</p><p> The <code>Pragma</code> header is generally ineffective because its
meaning is not standardized and few caches honor it.
Using <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=...&gt;</code> elements in HTML documents
is also generally ineffective; some browsers may honor such markup, but
other caches ignore it completely.

<p> You cannot interfere with the browser's right-click options with HTML.
Sometimes, JavaScript can do this, however:
</p><ul>
<li> These scripts annoy visitors who lose ready access to their
	browsers' normal context-menu functions (e.g., "Open in new window"
	or "Bookmark link").
	These scripts can also interfere with features like mouse gestures.
</li><li> Nothing (including these scripts) can prevent anyone from copying
	your source or images.
	The browser cannot display your document without the source and
	images, so your web server must send them to the browser.
	Even without the various "save" functions in today's browsers,
	someone can retrieve your source or images from the browser's cache,
	request them from the server with some other tool, or use a
	screen-capture tool to copy the images.
</li><li> These scripts do nothing when JavaScript is disabled or
	unavailable,
	when JavaScript access to right-click events is disabled,
	on systems without mice, or
	on systems with single-button mice.

<p> You can't.
URLs are fundamental to navigation on the WWW.
The URL is necessary for the browser to be able to retrieve your document.
It is impossible to hide the URL of a resource from the browser.

</p><p> With that said, it is possible to somewhat obscure URLs via a
misfeature of frames.

</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="32">4.12.</a> <a name="browser-detect">How do I detect what browser is being used?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p>Many browsers identify themselves when they request
a document. A CGI script will have this information available
in the HTTP_USER_AGENT environment variable, and it can use that
to send out a version of the document which is optimized for that
browser.</p>

<p>Keep in mind not all browsers identify themselves
correctly.
For example, Microsoft Internet Explorer identifies itself as Netscape
Navigator, and many other browsers identify themselves as Microsoft
Internet Explorer.
</p>

<p>And of course, if a cache proxy keeps a version intended for one
brower, someone with another browser may get that version, rather than
the version intended for the other browser.</p>

<p>For these reasons and others, it is not a good idea to play the browser
guessing game.</p>

</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="21">4.13.</a> <a name="get-address">How do I get my visitors' email addresses?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p>You can't. Although each request for a document is
usually logged with the name or address of the remote host, the
actual username is almost never logged as well. This is mostly
because of performance reasons, as it would require that the server
uses the ident protocol to see who is on the other end. This takes
time. And if a cache proxy is doing the request, you don't get
anything sensible.</p>

<p>But just stop to think for a minute... would you really want every single
site you visit to know your email address? Imagine the loads of automated
thank you's you would be receiving. If you visited 20 sites, you would get
at least 20 emails that day, plus no doubt they would send you invitations
to return later. It would be a nightmare as well as an invasion of privacy!</p>

<p>In Netscape 2.0, it was possible to automatically submit a form with a mailto
as action, using JavaScript. This would send email to the document's
owner, with the address the visitor configured in the From line. Of course,
that can be "mickey.mouse@disney.com". This was fixed by Netscape 2.01.</p>

<p>The most reliable way is to put up a form, asking the visitor to fill
in his email address. To increase the chances that visitors will
actually do it, offer them something useful in return.</p>



</div></li><li><h3><span class="plus_icon">+</span><a name="ignored-msg">4.14. Why is my custom 404 Not Found message not displayed?</a></h3><div class="answer">

<p> If no browser displays your custom 404 Not Found messages, then your
server probably is not configured properly.


</p><p> If only Internet Explorer ignores your custom 404 Not Found
messages, then you've been caught by its
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q218/1/55.asp">"friendly" HTTP error messages</a>.
When a special HTTP response (e.g., a 404 Not Found response) is shorter
than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer substitutes its own message for the
one delivered by the server.
As a user of Internet Explorer, you can disable this feature in the
"Advanced" options panel.
As a web author, your only recourse is to make your 404 Not Found
message longer.
